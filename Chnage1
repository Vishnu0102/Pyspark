You can convert the SQL query into PySpark code using the DataFrame API. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import lit

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("YourAppName").getOrCreate()

# Read the "Customers" table into a DataFrame
customers = spark.read.table("Customers")

# Define the three select statements and use unionAll to combine them
result = customers.select(customers.first_name.alias("name"),
                           customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                           customers.age.alias("ages"),
                           customers.country.alias("country"),
                           lit(None).alias("ids")) \
                  .unionAll(customers.select(customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                                              customers.age.alias("ages"),
                                              customers.country.alias("country"),
                                              lit(None).alias("ids"))) \
                  .unionAll(customers.select(customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                                              customers.age.alias("ages"),
                                              customers.country.alias("country"),
                                              customers.id.alias("ids")))

# You can show the result or write it to another table, as needed
result.show()

# Don't forget to stop the Spark session when you're done
spark.stop()
Make sure to replace "YourAppName" with an appropriate name for your Spark application, and adjust the table name if it's different from "Customers".

You can convert the SQL query into PySpark code with the provided join condition. Here's the PySpark code for your query:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("YourAppName").getOrCreate()

# Read the "Customers" and "Custom" tables into DataFrames
customers = spark.read.table("Customers")
custom = spark.read.table("Custom")

# Define the select statements and use unionAll to combine them
result = customers.select(customers.first_name.alias("name"),
                           customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                           customers.age.alias("ages"),
                           customers.country.alias("country"),
                           lit(None).alias("ids")) \
                  .unionAll(customers.select(customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                                              customers.age.alias("ages"),
                                              customers.country.alias("country"),
                                              lit(None).alias("ids"))) \
                  .unionAll(customers.join(custom, customers.id == custom.id)
                             .select(customers.last_name.alias("name"),
                                     customers.age.alias("ages"),
                                     customers.country.alias("country"),
                                     customers.id.alias("ids"),
                                     custom.id.alias("Customids")))

# You can insert the "result" DataFrame into the "Templ" table if needed
# result.write.mode("append").saveAsTable("Templ")

# You can also show the result
result.show()

# Don't forget to stop the Spark session when you're done
spark.stop()
Make sure to replace "YourAppName" with an appropriate name for your Spark application and adjust the table names accordingly. If you want to insert the result into the "Templ" table, you can uncomment the appropriate line and customize the write mode as needed.
